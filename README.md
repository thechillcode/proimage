# proimg
proimg is a set of functions that allow you to manipulate a 2D image buffer.
The image buffer is only one channel e.g. only the color Red of an RGB image.
The main advantage is that the functions become very versatile and do not have to consider the image type or bits per pixels.
This makes writing new functions and implementing them very easy.
